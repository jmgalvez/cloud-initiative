Let's verify that the cluster is up and running...

Usually, it takes some seconds....so please be patient...

# List namespaces

Just run (remember the TAB key): `kubectl get namespaces`

Now try with: `kubectl get ns`

You may run: `kubectl api-resources` and check for the second columen named SHORTNAMES. Those are the valid ones that you can use to speed up your kubectl commands.

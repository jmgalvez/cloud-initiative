# Final step

Now, please create a **multicontainer pod** (or modify the existing one) trying to use what you learned so far or, in the worst case, please go to kubernetes.io/docs only.

i.e. you could busybox or another nginx..it really does not matter.

Please notice that there is another concept, called _initContainers_ which are different than a normal container. We could check on kubernetes.io/docs if we have time.
